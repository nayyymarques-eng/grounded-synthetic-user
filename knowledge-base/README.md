# The knowledge base

The rules your users work under, one page per topic, each rule pointing to its official text. The agent reads these pages before it answers. It is not a copy of the law: it holds only the rules the product depends on.

## One rule, one row

| ID | Rule | Source | Applies | Checked on | Mark | Check again on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PRIV-01 | One rule, in plain words | The official text, article and address | Jurisdiction, from (and until) | Date and who read it | checked or to confirm | Date |

- **ID**: a short code that stays the same when the wording changes. Reports and eval cases cite it, so a rule change finds every review that used the rule.
- **Applies**: the jurisdiction and the date the rule takes effect. When a newer version replaces it, the old row gets the date it ends and stays on the page, because work from before the change may still follow it.
- **Checked on**: the date a person read the official text, and who. Empty until then.
- **Mark**: `to confirm` or `checked`. Agents add rules as `to confirm`. Only a person marks a rule `checked`; the hook refuses any agent edit that does.
- **Check again on**: when the rule must be read again. For a value the authority updates on a known date, that date. For the rest, the interval your business sets (see below).

## Who changes what

| Who | What they may do |
|---|---|
| The synthetic user | Add a missing rule it read in the official text, marked `to confirm` |
| The rules watch | Turn a rule back to `to confirm` when its source changed or its date passed, and add the new version next to it |
| A person | Read the official text, mark a rule `checked`, set the end date of an old version |

The knowledge base lives in your repository, so every change shows in a pull request.

## Set for your business

- **Official sources the agents may open**: list them here, with their addresses. A rule from a source an agent cannot open (behind a login, on paper) stays a gap until a person reads it.
- **Interval for "check again on"**: for example, six months after a person checks it.

## The example

`privacy-requests.md` is the knowledge base of a made-up product. Replace it with your own topics.
